# Convert Spotify Playlist to YouTube Playlist

A program I created in order to convert your Spotify Playlist to a YouTube Playlist.
- Uses the YouTube Data API in order to automate creating a playlist and adding the videos/songs into the playlist.
- Uses the spotipy library to retrieve the songs that are in one of your playlists that you selected to be converted.

In order to use this program, you must create an application/project within the Spotify Developers Console and Google Developers Console.
You will then be able to get the client ids, client secrets, and API keys from both the programs.

Input the Spotify client id and client secret into the secrets.json file.
Input the Google client id, client secret, and API key into the client_secrets.json file.
